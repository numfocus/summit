# Breakout discussion workflow

## Plan

- Please break into small groups of no more than 8 people. If you have more than 8 people, break into multiple groups that independently discuss the topic. 
- Once you have a group please designate a **moderator**, a **note taker**, and a **reporter**.
	- The **moderator** should make sure that everyone has a chance to speak and no one person dominates the discussion. Also please pay attention to the [code of conduct](https://www.numfocus.org/code-of-conduct).
	-  The **note takers** should take notes in a Google doc with help from everyone in the group.
	-  The **reporter** can be a third person, or can be the same as the moderator or note taker. 
		-  Please create a google doc under your account
		-  Make it editable by anyone with the link
		-  Paste in the link to your doc into this sheet: https://goo.gl/Z1jeoJ
    -  Copy & Paste the following information into your doc:
```
Discussion topic:
