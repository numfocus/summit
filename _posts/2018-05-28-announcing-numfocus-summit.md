We are happy to announce that the NumFOCUS Summit will occur at Microsoft Technology Center in New York City.  

This year we plan to have several events during the week.  

Friday, Sept 21: Welcome Reception (location to be announced)  
Saturday - Sunday, Sept 22-23: Sustainability Workshop  
Sunday, Sept 23: Evening Awards Gala  
Monday - Tuesday, Sept 24-25: Project Forum  
Monday - Tuesday, Sept 24-25: Project Sprints  

As we finalize plans we are looking for volunteers to serve as chairs for each event. The chairs will be responsible for organizing content and working with NF Staff. We expect that being a chair will only require a few hours a week. More information on chairing can be found on the conference site ([summit.numfocus.org](summit.numfocus.org)). If you are interested in serving please reach out to [summit@numfocus.org](mailto://summit@numfocus.org)
