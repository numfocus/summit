It's hard to believe but the summit is only about a week away. Here are some things you can do to prepare:

## Join our Slack Team

We have created a Slack Team specifically for the Summit so folks can easily connect, receive announcements, and search for information. You are invited to join it [here](https://join.slack.com/t/nfsummit2018/shared_invite/enQtNDI0MzI1NjI0MTYwLWJmNjNiMTc2ZGIxZjliYTBiYzE1MDQzNTgxYTZhODU4YWVmZDQ2OGJlMDlhYWMwMTVhYzRlMmU1NzIwZTliYjk).
